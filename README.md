Kaggle machine learning competition data and python notebooks. 

Competitions Included
Here's a list of the Kaggle competitions included in this repository:

Competition 1 Name: House Prices Advanced Regression.
Working in this competition, I've learnt about the awesome pycaret library which is used for building a pipeline of all ML models ny taking small portions of the actual training data. This library runs lighting fast. 

Competition 2 Name: Titanic Survival Classification.
This competition is an intense one as I have learnt about the mapping of training data with the test data. There is a legit problem of number of classes mismatching for the same feature in training and test data, which should be taken into acount in the data processing phase.
